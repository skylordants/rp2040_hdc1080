# HDC1080 library for RP2040

This is a library I created for my [personal project](https://github.com/skylordants/Pico_receiver). I'm sharing it, in case it is helpful to somebody and to make my code public, but I don't intend on regularily maintaining it, because it works for me, unless something big happens.

## Usage
The simplest way to use the library is to include it in a platformio project using [wizio-pico baremetal](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/wizio-pico) platform, but other projects using the RP2040 SDK should work as well. It depends on my [I2C](https://github.com/skylordants/rp2040_i2c) library, but can be made to work without it one quite easily.

An HDC1080 object can be created by calling it's constructor and giving it a pointer to the RP2040_I2C object. After that, the method *measure* can be called, and if it returns *true*, then the variables *temperature* and *humidity* contain the new values. Methods *calculate_current_temperature* and *calculate_current_humidity* can be used to easily get the current measurements in Â°C and % units respectively.

If the raw measurements are from another source, for example from another microcontroller connected to an HDC1080 sensor, which sends the measurements over 433 MHz radio, then the functions *calculate_temperature* and *calculate_humidity* can be used to calculate the correct units without creating the HDC1080 object.

## Sources
It is based on the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/hdc1080.pdf).
